# Purpose

This script goes through a hierarchical directory structure containing RAW, JPEG, and TIFF images.
It then

. Runs through the directory and removes all thumbnail JPEGs
. If neccessary, converts RAW to JPEG
. Adds exif data to the JPEG or TIFF, including the original file location, name, copyright, and a blank XPKeywords tags
. Makes sure the image is not bigger than 16K x 16K pixels
. Saves the JPG or TIFF with a new file name of year_month_day_originalName.jpg into the staging area



## TODO
We need a script to copy from the NAS to a staging area.
One of it's main tasks is to only copy JPEGs if there is NOT a RAW image
with the same name.
It should only copy RAW files and images into the new directory for staging.
It also needs to duplicate the directory structure
