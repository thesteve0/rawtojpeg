# Purpose

These scripts go through a hierarchical directory structure to prepare RAW and JPEG images for AI work.
It expects a directory containing images and other sub-directories containing images.


First run `just_camera_files.py` to clear the directory of files we obviously don't want to run AI on.

Deletes:
1. Files that aren't JPEG or RAW
2. Thumbnails generated either in camera or in software
3. Files from phone cameras

*Done - files now in D:\pictures_for_AI*

Now run `main.py` which will

. If there is a JPEG and RAW with the same name - remove the RAW file
. If necessary, converts RAW to JPEG
. Adds exif data to the JPEG, including the original file location, name, copyright, and a blank XPKeywords tags
. Makes sure the image is not bigger than 16K x 16K pixels
. Saves the JPG with a new file name of year_month_day_originalName.jpg into the staging area. The staging area contains only files and no directories



## TODO
We need a script to copy from the NAS to a staging area.
One of it's main tasks is to only copy JPEGs if there is NOT a RAW image
with the same name.
It should only copy RAW files and images into the new directory for staging.
It also needs to duplicate the directory structure

No Photos from phone camers - the only images we should really care about for now are those with exif for make =
'EASTMAN KODAK COMPANY'
'FUJIFILM'
'NIKON'
'Panasonic'
'Canon'
'NIKON CORPORATION'
'Konica Minolta Photo Imaging, Inc.'
'OLYMPUS CORPORATION    '
'Sony'
'SONY'
